      <h3>Project Description: </h3><p>By running 'node index.js', the user can enter responses for several questions to generate a README of their own.  The file takes in the user's responses and runs an axios command to generate the README basd on those responses.  For certain questions, if the user does not answer and leaves them blank, there is a default response stored that is used as the answer instead.</p>
